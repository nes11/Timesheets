# Timesheets

Create, store and validate timesheets.  
This is my first app that puts the whole MERN stack to work. After writing tests for the appâ€™s functionality (using Chai and Axios), I built it up incrementally, starting with a MVP. On the way, I became better acquainted with Express.js, discovered the joys of Promises with Async/await, used [CRUD ops](https://github.com/nes11/mongodbCRUD) after creating a database with MongoDB (that I ran in a Docker container), and had fun with React.js and Material- UI.
